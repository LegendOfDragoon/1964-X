* In general, you should use the language name in its own language as the filename, end with '.lng'
* Such filenames may be not loadable by the Windows/OS in other languages
* You can also name the file in english, so everyone can access it.
* If a language file is loadable, the filename will be used in the language selection menu
* regardless of the current selected language

* length for menu item usually does not matter since menu has always enough space to display the strings
* length for dialog item texts must be paid special attention because the dialog item text
* space is limited, you should try to use the shortest translation or acronyms.
* Since you may not have the beta 1964.exe to test your translation with, please do your best
* for the moment, and test your translation when it is available for you.
